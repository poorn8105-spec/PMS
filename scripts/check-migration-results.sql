-- 2. Check patient phones migration

-- 3. Check patients with multiple phones

LEFT JOIN patient_phones pp ON p.id = pp.patient_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.first_name, p.last_name
HAVING COUNT(pp.phone) > 1

-- 4. Check linked appointments with patient info
SELECT

-- 5. Check unlinked appointments (if any)
SELECT

-- 7. Check triggers
SELECT
