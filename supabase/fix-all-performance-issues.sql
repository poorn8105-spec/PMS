-- ðŸ”§ Fix All Performance Issues - Complete Solution
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- This script fixes ALL performance issues identified by Supabase linter:
-- 1. Auth RLS Initialization Plan issues (6 warnings)
-- 2. Multiple Permissive Policies (20 warnings) 
-- 3. Duplicate Indexes (1 warning)
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: FIX DUPLICATE INDEXES
-- =====================================================

-- Remove duplicate index on dental_treatments
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_dental_treatments_patient;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: FIX AUTH RLS INITIALIZATION PLAN ISSUES
-- =====================================================

-- Fix user_roles policies - use (select auth.function()) for better performance
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own roles" ON user_roles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own roles" ON user_roles
  FOR SELECT USING ((select auth.uid()) = user_id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Clinic admins can manage user roles" ON user_roles;
CREATE POLICY "Clinic admins can manage user roles" ON user_roles
  FOR ALL USING ((select auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin');

-- Fix security_audit_log policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admin can read security audit log" ON security_audit_log;
CREATE POLICY "Super admin can read security audit log" ON security_audit_log
  FOR SELECT USING ((select auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'super_admin');

-- Fix login_attempts policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admin can read login attempts" ON login_attempts;
CREATE POLICY "Super admin can read login attempts" ON login_attempts
  FOR SELECT USING ((select auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'super_admin');

-- Fix captcha_attempts policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admin can read captcha attempts" ON captcha_attempts;
CREATE POLICY "Super admin can read captcha attempts" ON captcha_attempts
  FOR SELECT USING ((select auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'super_admin');

-- Fix staff_permissions policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to manage staff permissions" ON staff_permissions;
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to manage staff permissions" ON staff_permissions
  FOR ALL USING ((select auth.uid()) IS NOT NULL);

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: FIX MULTIPLE PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Remove generic "Allow all operations" policies that conflict with specific ones
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on dental_treatments" ON dental_treatments;

-- Remove conflicting user_roles policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Clinic admins can manage user roles" ON user_roles;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 4: CREATE OPTIMIZED POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Create specific dental_treatments policies (if they don't exist)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Authenticated users can access clinic dental treatments" ON dental_treatments
  FOR ALL USING (
    (select auth.uid()) IS NOT NULL 
    AND clinic_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM clinics 
      WHERE id IN (
        SELECT clinic_id FROM staff_permissions 
        WHERE user_email = (select auth.jwt() ->> 'email')
      )
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Patients can access their own dental treatments" ON dental_treatments
  FOR SELECT USING (
    patient_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM patients 
      WHERE phone = (select auth.jwt() ->> 'phone')
      OR email = (select auth.jwt() ->> 'email')
    )
  );

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 5: VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

-- Check final policy count for dental_treatments
SELECT 
  'DENTAL_TREATMENTS' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cmd) as unique_operations,
  COUNT(DISTINCT roles) as unique_roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'dental_treatments';

-- Check final policy count for user_roles
SELECT 
  'USER_ROLES' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cmd) as unique_operations,
  COUNT(DISTINCT roles) as unique_roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'user_roles';

-- Check final index count for dental_treatments
SELECT 
  'DENTAL_TREATMENTS' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as index_count,
  string_agg(indexname, ', ') as index_names
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'dental_treatments';

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 6: PERFORMANCE IMPACT SUMMARY
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS ===' as section;

SELECT 
  'Auth RLS Optimization' as improvement,
  'Reduced auth function calls from per-row to per-query' as description,
  'High' as impact
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Duplicate Policy Removal' as improvement,
  'Eliminated conflicting RLS policies' as description,
  'Medium' as impact
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Duplicate Index Removal' as improvement,
  'Removed redundant index on patient_id column' as description,
  'Low' as impact;
