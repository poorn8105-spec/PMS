-- ðŸ”§ FIX INFINITE RECURSION IN RLS POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 1. DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== DIAGNOSING INFINITE RECURSION ===' as section;

-- Check current user_roles policies

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX USER_ROLES POLICIES (REMOVE SELF-REFERENCE)
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== FIXING USER_ROLES POLICIES ===' as section;

-- Drop all user_roles policies
