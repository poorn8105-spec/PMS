-- ðŸ”§ COMPREHENSIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM FIX
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 1. COMPLETE DIAGNOSIS
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== COMPLETE PAYMENT DIAGNOSIS ===' as section;

-- Check if payment tables exist
SELECT 
    'treatment_payments' as table_name,
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'treatment_payments' AND table_schema = 'public') as exists
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'payment_transactions' as table_name,
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'payment_transactions' AND table_schema = 'public') as exists;

-- Check table structures
SELECT 
    'treatment_payments structure' as info,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'treatment_payments'
AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

SELECT 
    'payment_transactions structure' as info,
    column_name,
    data_type,

-- Check RLS status

FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('treatment_payments', 'payment_transactions');

-- Check all policies
SELECT

    roles,
    cmd,
    qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('treatment_payments', 'payment_transactions')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. COMPLETE RESET OF PAYMENT SYSTEM
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== COMPLETE PAYMENT SYSTEM RESET ===' as section;

-- Disable RLS temporarily
ALTER TABLE treatment_payments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE payment_transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies

-- =====================================================
-- 3. RECREATE PAYMENT TABLES IF NEEDED
-- =====================================================

-- Recreate payment_transactions table
CREATE TABLE payment_transactions (

  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,
  transaction_id TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  payment_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

-- =====================================================
-- 4. CREATE INDEXES
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== CREATING INDEXES ===' as section;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_treatment_payments_treatment_id ON treatment_payments(treatment_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_treatment_payments_clinic_id ON treatment_payments(clinic_id);

-- =====================================================
-- 5. CREATE FUNCTIONS
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== CREATING FUNCTIONS ===' as section;

-- Create payment status update function

    NOW()
  ) RETURNING id INTO v_transaction_id;
  
  RETURN v_transaction_id;
END;

-- =====================================================
-- 6. CREATE TRIGGERS
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== CREATING TRIGGERS ===' as section;

CREATE TRIGGER update_treatment_payment_status 
  BEFORE UPDATE ON treatment_payments 
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_payment_status();

CREATE TRIGGER update_treatment_payment_on_transaction_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON payment_transactions
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_treatment_payment_on_transaction();

-- =====================================================
-- 7. ENABLE RLS WITH SIMPLE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== ENABLING RLS ===' as section;

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE treatment_payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE payment_transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all treatment payments" ON treatment_payments

    FOR ALL USING (true);

-- =====================================================
-- 8. GRANT PERMISSIONS
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== GRANTING PERMISSIONS ===' as section;

GRANT ALL ON treatment_payments TO authenticated;

-- =====================================================
-- 9. TEST THE SYSTEM
-- =====================================================

SELECT '=== TESTING PAYMENT SYSTEM ===' as section;

-- Test table access
SELECT

-- =====================================================
-- 10. SUCCESS MESSAGE
